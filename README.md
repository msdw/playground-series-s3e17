# 3rd solution | based on 90% multi AutoML solutions
Many thanks to Kaggle for this Season 3, Episode 17 Playground Series competition.
A big thank you to the people who contributed on forum and notebooks and share with us good insights.

## Overview
I used several AutoML approaches and used a meta model based on them

- Light AutoML
- Statmining AutoML (ISoft private solution)
- H2O AutoML
- Lazy Classifier
- FLAML
=> the first 3 solutions are those that contribute the most to the final model.
=> the 10% of the model comes from the 2 best public submissions
## Execution Time
The execution time of the solution on a machine with 4 cores and 8Go RAM is about 6h. I limit each automl solution to 1 hour max execution time.

## LB Scores
Public LB Score: 0.97921
Private LB Score: 0.98541
The chosen solutions are almost the best obtained the public leaderboard and the private leaderboard

Note that a solution including pseudo labeling performed slightly better.
